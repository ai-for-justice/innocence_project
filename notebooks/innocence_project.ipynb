Robert was convicted of a triple-homicide that occurred on a Texas nursery in \"South\" Tilden, which he identifies as the place of the crime. The letter does not provide a date for when the crime took place or when he was convicted.\\n\\nIn his account, Robert persists in claiming his innocence. He expresses hope for someone to assist him with his case and express that he has been praying for divine help. He suggests that he hasn\\'t given up hope even after the first two years of his incarceration and strongly believes these years have passed by the grace of God. He is still seeking assistance and looking for an individual or entity to hear his case, believing that this could lead to the revelation of his being wrongfully convicted.\\n\\nHe indicates a belief that a DNA test would prove his innocence and seems to focus on this as a key piece of evidence that has not been properly explored in his case. His emphasis on DNA points to the possibility that no such test has been administered or its results were not accounted for in his trial or appeals. Moreover, Robert believes that if someone were to examine the details of his case, they would also come to the conclusion that he is not guilty.\\n\\nRobert has been incarcerated at La Salle Prison for 12 years, struggling due to a lack of financial resources, but remains persistent in his efforts to prove innocence based on a strong personal conviction of not being guilty.\\n\\nHe does not mention any alibi or specific pieces of evidence supporting his innocence, apart from his assertion of a potentially exculpatory DNA test. There is also no direct mention of any connections or relationships to the victims or others involved in the case, nor are any details provided about the events surrounding the crime from his perspective.\\n\\nFinally, Robert found the recipient of the letter through a friend and is asking for assistance, be it a review of his case or any help possible. He closes the letter with a sense of urgency and a plea for a re-assessment of his case, expressing gratitude and well wishes for the recipient and their family.'"

Williams, is 35 years old.\\n  \\n- Specifics of the crime: Williams is serving a life sentence for the attempted murder of a Baton Rouge woman, which he states he did not commit.\\n\\n- Account of events surrounding the crime: The letter does not detail Williams\\' specific account of the events other than him asserting his innocence.\\n\\n- Alibi or evidence: Williams claims that a DNA test could prove his innocence. He seems to strongly believe that this evidence would be enough to establish his innocence regarding the crime he was convicted for.\\n\\n- Connections or relationships: He references the victim as the wife of a \"big-time Baton Rouge Attorney,\" suggesting that this connection may have influenced the willingness of local entities to take on his case.\\n\\n- Stance on conviction: Williams disputes his conviction, maintaining his innocence, and expresses a feeling of abandonment by the system, stating that after the first two years, people generally cease to care about individuals in his situation. Moreover, he feels ignored by the legal system, specifying that no one in Baton Rouge wants his case, which he attributes to the status of the victim\\'s husband.\\n\\nHe concludes the letter by expressing hope that the recipient, Mr. Barry, will find it in their heart to help him and states that he would appreciate any form of assistance, even if it is just reading about his case. He found Mr. Barry through talking to a friend, and although he acknowledges that Mr. Barry must be very busy, he remains hopeful for some assistance. Williams closes with gratitude and a blessing for Mr. Barry and his family.'"

      "- Alibi or evidence: Mr. Williams believes that if he could obtain a DNA test, it would prove his innocence.\n",
      "- Connections or relationships with the victim(s) or others involved in the case: The victim is implied to be the wife of a \"Big time Baton Rouge Attorney,\" which, according to Mr. Williams, is the reason why no one wants to take his case in Baton Rouge. He suggests that this connection may be influencing his ability to find someone to take on his case.\n",
      "- Stance on conviction: Mr. Williams is adamant that he is innocent and should not have been convicted. He is seeking assistance, feeling that he has been let down after the first two years of trying to seek help, and thinks that if someone were to review his case, they would recognize his innocence.\n",
