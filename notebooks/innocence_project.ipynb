He seems to strongly believe that this evidence would be enough to establish his innocence regarding the crime he was convicted for.\\n\\n- Connections or relationships: He references the victim as the wife of a \"big-time Baton Rouge Attorney,\" suggesting that this connection may have influenced the willingness of local entities to take on his case.\\n\\n- Stance on conviction: Williams disputes his conviction, maintaining his innocence, and expresses a feeling of abandonment by the system, stating that after the first two years, people generally cease to care about individuals in his situation. Moreover, he feels ignored by the legal system, specifying that no one in Baton Rouge wants his case, which he attributes to the status of the victim\\'s husband.\\n\\nHe concludes the letter by expressing hope that the recipient, Mr. Barry, will find it in their heart to help him and states that he would appreciate any form of assistance, even if it is just reading about his case. He found Mr. Barry through talking to a friend, and although he acknowledges that Mr. Barry must be very busy, he remains hopeful for some assistance.
